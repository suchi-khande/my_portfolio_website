                <h2> Leveraging Deep Learning for Accurate Pneumonia Diagnosis in X-Ray Imaging</h2>
                <p>This study employs cutting-edge deep learning models, such as ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, and ResNet-50
                    v2, to improve the precision of pneumonia diagnosis using CXR pictures. Environment Tools: Google Colab,
                    Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, tensorflow, and Sklearn
                    Project Description: Pneumonia is a prevalent viral disease that impacts a substantial number of the
                    population, especially in developing and low-income nations with insufficient healthcare infrastructure and living
                    conditions that can worsen the transmission of the sickness. This study employs cutting-edge, deep learning
                    models, such as ResNet-50, ResNet-101, VGG-16, and ResNet-50 v2, to improve the precision of pneumonia
                    diagnosis using CXR pictures.</p>

                <h2>Multiclass Deep Weeds Detection</h2>
                <p> The DeepWeeds project aims to address the critical need for effective weed management in
                    rangeland environments, a topic often overlooked in favor of croplands. With the rising importance of robotic
                    solutions in agriculture, the project leverages the power of deep learning to develop robust weed classification
                    systems, facilitating the deployment of autonomous weed control technologies.Environment Tools: Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Skelearn. Project</p>

                <h2>Diabeties prediction</h2>
                <p>In my diabetes prediction project, I focus on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data. This involves collecting and preprocessing data, such as blood glucose levels, BMI, age, and family history, to create a clean dataset for analysis. I use algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to build predictive models. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. The goal is to create a reliable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans for diabetes patients.</p>
